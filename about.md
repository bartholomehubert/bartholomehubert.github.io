Hello, I am a currently high school student in Belgium. On this blog I share a few weekend projects, mostly about computers and math, which I try to learn do during my free time. This blog is more of an experiment, I will maybe post more seriously later on, but for now it is just for enjoyment.

My email address can be found in this page's footer.
